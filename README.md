The purpose of a memory test is to confirm that each storage location in a memory device is working. In other words, if you store the number 50 at a particular address, you expect to find that number stored there until another number is written to that same address. The basic idea behind any memory test, then, is to write some set of data to each address in the memory device and verify the data by reading it back. If all the values read back are the same as those that were written, then the memory device is said to pass the test. As you will see, it is only through careful selection of the set of data values that you can be sure that a passing result is meaningful.
A memory test is a piece of software that nearly every embedded developer is required to write at some point in their career. When the prototype hardware is complete, the board's designer frequently wants to know that she wired the address and data lines correctly and that the various memory chips are operational. Even if this is not the case, any onboard RAM should be tested at least once per system reset. The embedded software developer must then determine what can go wrong and design a suite of tests to detect problems.
